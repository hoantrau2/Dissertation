CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findserial_driver1.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "serial_driver1", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "serial_driver1"
  with any of the following names:

    serial_driver1Config.cmake
    serial_driver1-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "serial_driver1" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "serial_driver1_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "serial_driver1" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
